# photo-dev
This is an android application that guides users through the photo development process, and calculates timing depending on factors like temperature or film type.

#Idea behind this project
The idea for this application stemmed from a thought that Keenan had in his Photography class - there should be an app to assist students with the film development process.

Developing films in a darkroom involves a delicate, orderly, and methodical approach. There are chemicals that require mixing in specification ratios of dilution, solutions that need to be brought to a precise temperature and agitated at regular intervals, tanks that require a set amount of cleaning, and reels that need to be swirled and hung for a specific duration. Listed below are the 9 activities that photo developers in the Photography class have to perform in a strict and regulated order when developing films in the darkroom. 

1.	Ready solutions 
2.	Pour developer
3.	Stop Bath
4.	Fix
5.	Rinse
6.	Hypo-clear
7.	Wash
8.	Photo-flo
9.	Dry

#Project Goal
We have decided to make an android application called PhotoDev that will enable photo developers in photography class to stay on top of their film development process. The application will effectively guide the user through the whole development process step-by-step, calculate the timings required based on factors like temperature, film-type, and number of reels, and send alerts and notifications when a procedure is complete. The application will be composed of at least 10 activities, one for each of the aforementioned steps in film development along with the Main Activity. Below are initial mockups of how our application may look like along a guide on film development, and temperature and time charts (which will be implemented on our app). 
As Dr. Hoot offered us some great suggestions to make the development process a bit more challenging and the final app to look more polished and appealing. So, we have decided to take his ideas into account and implement visually appealing animations and switchable sound indicators in our app. If possible, we will also implement voice clips. And last but not least, we will also implement the use of local storage to save a userâ€™s settings and preferences in order to make the app more user-oriented.
